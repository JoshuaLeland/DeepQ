# DeepQ

Code used from Berkley Reinforcement learning class here: http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/

I also used the pseudocode from this blog as a template: https://towardsdatascience.com/double-deep-q-networks-905dd8325412

If you just want to see it run, open then notebook, but don't run the train function.  Skip it, and run the bottom cells and it will render an episode using the parameters from the "current_state"
